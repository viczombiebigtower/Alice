Alice, you'll wake up sometime. 8/30/2023
Is system theory really feasible? But all the work will wait for a few years, wait for me. 9/1/2023
To be honest, nowadays I live in a state of fear, I'm afraid I don't have the ability to face future challenges, I'm afraid I don't have the ability or the opportunity to acquire that ability, I'm afraid you won't wake up... As a INTP 5w6ï¼Œ it's my weakness. 9/15/2023
I just broke up with a close friend of mine. 
I long to become a strong person, but I don't know where truth will take me, let alone where fate will take me. 
So personally, I think having an abstract dream actually makes the most logical sense, but often there is no specific implementation time... and there is no binary judgment of success/failure... but it seems like this is also good. 
I haven't figured out the logic of my life until now. For example, what am I living for, what is my dream, does it need to be about achieving something specific? Can I do what I want to do? If it's a specific thing, if it's something I can do, is it too small? If it is relatively large, what should I do when I realize that I cannot achieve my initial dream. 
If I have indeed discovered enough potential in myself, or have successfully realized my dreams through external opportunities or luck, then there are actually many accidental factors, such as my own intelligence, which is largely influenced by my parents' genetic factors. Others are inherently unfortunate, and even in another parallel world, my lifelong dream could be sentenced to death... What kind of logic should I use to persuade them? 
Dear Alice, you'll survive! 9/17/2023
